## Full List of Command Prompt Commands

This project is available and free to everyone to enjoy!.

The Command Prompt in Windows provides access to over 280 commands. These commands are used to do certain operating system tasks from a command-line interface instead of the graphical Windows interface we use most of the time.

For example, Command Prompt commands let you copy data to a different folder, format an entire disk, back up your files, send messages to other computers, restart your own computer, and much more. There are also several Command Prompt tricks and hacks that utilize some of these commands. 

CMD Commands
Below is a complete list of Command Prompt commands, often called CMD commands (and sometimes incorrectly as Command Prompt codes), available from the Command Prompt in Windows 10, Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Vista, and Windows XP.

Since these commands work within the context of Command Prompt, you have to open Command Prompt to utilize them.
